# Final Project

# Domain of Interest

Our domain of interest for this project is the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We aim to examine and analyze existing data surrounding this virus.

We are interested in this field/domain because it is extremely relevant and pertinent to society today, globally, with the COVID-19 pandemic. This virus has impacted the world and so many people in a multitude of ways, so we are interested in learning more about some of the impacts this disease and pandemic have had on our society.  Each of us have also been impacted by COVID-19 in some way (e.g. experiencing our college education online), so it is a domain relevant to our lives as well.

## Data-Driven Projects

- One data-driven project related to this domain (COVID-19) is a 2020 project by Pulse Lab New York, partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO).
  https://www.unglobalpulse.org/project/understanding-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-real-time/
  This project aims to mitigate the misinformation and ignorance surrounding this virus by providing real-time data and statistics on the pandemic and spread of
  the virus to the general public. This is in hopes of spreading the information to people who rely on it the most (government/authority members, healthcare
  workers, and the rest of society) to convey the real facts.

- An additional data-driven project is the COVID Tracking Project.
  https://covidtracking.com/data
  This website has an extensive list of COVID-19-related data, incuding death rates, testing rates, case rates, hospitalization rates, etc. Similar to the prior
  project, this project aims to provide accurate information regarding the spread of the virus so that the general public has access to this information and the
  misinformation regarding COVID is therefore mitigated. 

- Another data-driven project is the COVID-19 Data Project, partnered with BroadStreet. 
  https://covid19dataproject.org/
  This project provides data at both state and county levels, so people can stay up to date with their local and greater communities. The data is extremely
  extensive, focusing primarily on cases/deaths and racial/ethnic disparities. The project aims to provide data that will help individuals have a better
  understanding of how the pandemic is affecting their communities. 

## Data-Driven Questions

Some data-driven questions we hope to be able to answer are:

Q1: Is there a relationship between vaccination rates and number of deaths due to COVID-19?
- We can look at data on vaccination rates in countries and compare it to data on the number of confirmed deaths to analyze for any patterns or relationships.

Q2: Are the number of COVID-19 deaths different among different racial/ethnic groups?
- We can answer this question by comparing the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 as an underlying disease among different racial/ethnic groups.

Q3: Are the number of COVID-19 deaths different among different age groups?
- To answer this question, we can use data on COVID-19 mortalities to compare the number of COVID-19 deaths among different age groups (eg. 0-10, 11-20, etc.).

Q4: Are there disparities in COVID-19 deaths between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties?
- We can answer this question by analyzing data on COVID-19 deaths among more urbanized metropolitan US counties and non-metropolitan counties.

# Finding Data

## Source 1:
This [first data source](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/AH-Monthly-provisional-counts-of-deaths-by-age-gro/65mz-jvh5) is a CDC provided breakdown of Covid-19 deaths by demographic groups. This data was collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, who compiled US resident death certificates starting on January 1st, 2019.
- There are 3,360 rows and 39 columns in this data.
- We can use this data to answer questions 2 and 3, as outlined above.

## Source 2:
Our [second data source](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) comes from OurWorldInData, whose data was collected and compiled by Hannah Ritchie, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, Diana Beltekian, Edouard Mathieu, Joe Hasell, Bobbie Macdonald, Charlie Giattino, Cameron Appel, Lucas Rod√©s-Guirao and Max Roser. This data contains information for every country and for different dates, and gives the total cases, new cases, deaths, and other such information per million people.
 - There are 87,327 observations and 25 features in this data.
 - We can use this for information on vaccination rates to understand the correlation between vaccine use and case/death rates.


## Source 3:
Our [third data souce](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Urbanicity-and-Week/hkhc-f7hg) comes from official CDC data site. This set of data was collected and provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. Deaths in this data set were tabulated by the county where the death occured and submitted to the NCHS for reporting purpose. This data set contains information about the total number of deaths and total number of COVID deaths in the United States for counties. The counties are categorized by Urban-Rural Classification Scheme where there're two categories: metropolitan and non-metropolitan.
- There're 11 features and 210 observations in this data.
- We can use the information in this data set to answer the question about disparities in COVID-19 deaths between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties as outlined above.
